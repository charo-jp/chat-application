## Scalability

### What is Scalability?

It refers to the ability of a database to handle increasing amounts of data, numbers of users, and types of requests without sacrificing performance or availability.

### Two types of Scalability

- **Vertical Scalability**
  It adds processors and memory to a single server so that it can handle more transactions.

- **Horizontal Scalability**
  It distributes data to multiple databases to improve performance and reliability (e.g. recovering from server crash)

## Join Table

- A table that achieves many-to-many relation between two tables.
  In this application, ChatRoomMember is the join table of ChatRoom and User.
